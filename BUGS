IkiWiki::Plugins::syntax BUGS
=============================

- lib/IkiWiki/Plugin/syntax.pm:
    - The file parameter isn't working when doesn't contain a full path.
    - Breaks the markdown indented chain. It can't be used between paragraphs
      of one list item. Use it after the item text. 

- templates/syntax.tmpl:
    - Use the description field as the documentation says.
